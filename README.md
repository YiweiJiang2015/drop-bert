# drop_bert

This repository contains the code for our CS 287 spring 2019 final project.

The code requires pytorch and allennlp.

The `notebooks` folder contains notebooks for generating specs for the DROP dataset and metrics for a trained model, as well
as a sample notebook containing a sample `allennlp train` command we used to train our models.

The `drop_bert` folder contains our models.

The `config` folder contains the JSON configurations needed to run the models using `allennlp train`.
